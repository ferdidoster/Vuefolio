    <h2>Hi, I’m Ferdi!</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a software engineer with a passion for building clean, intuitive, and functional websites and applications.

      Outside of coding, you’ll find me gaming, hitting the gym, exploring new tech, or taking on challenges to grow my skills.

      I thrive on collaboration and innovation, and I’m always eager to connect with others in the tech community. Whether solving complex problems or building from scratch, I’m here to learn, contribute, and create meaningful solutions.
